            <p><b>Our exhibits provide an interactive glimpse of life for early Florida Pioneers - before the days of
                    computers, cell phones, televisions or even cars.</b></p>

            <p>In a society of visual stimulation, “one-click” gratification and digital convenience, children can
                rarely experience the type of tangible leg work that was implemented to create the environment in which
                they live.</p>

            <p>To build, create and, ultimately survive, early Florida settlers had to take advantage of the physical
                resources around them. At the Schoolhouse, children will be surrounded by child-sized replicas of those
                resources, which through <b>touch, play and interaction</b> will provide them with a historically-based,
                sensory learning experience.</p>

            <p class="common-subtitle">Jupiter Lighthouse</p>

            <p>Interact with this 15 foot replica of the Jupiter Inlet Lighthouse is home to Hannibal Dillingham Pierce,
                the assistant lighthouse keeper in 1872. Created exclusively for the Schoolhouse, Pierce will share a
                short
                historic tale with children and families as they enter the Schoolhouse after a simple knock on the
                lighthouse door.</p>


            <p class="common-subtitle">Front Information Desk</p>

            <p>Be greeted by friendly staff and volunteers upon entering the Schoolhouse. During regular business hours,
                a
                representative will always be available to give a tour, answer or facilitate any questions about
                exhibits,

            <p class="common-subtitle">Faces of the Community</p>

            <p>Before you enter the Time Travels exhibit area, pause a moment to gaze upon the faces of our area’s early
                pioneers and learn more about their adventures in constructing early South Florida.  Visitors can gaze
                into
                the eyes of children who went to school here nearly 100 years ago through large, restored class photos
                that
                date back to the 1950s.</p>

                <p class="p-underline">Train</p>

                <p>Ring the bell, yell “All Aboard,” grab the passengers, and hop onboard the Orange Blossom Express for
                    a
                    ride
                    back in time to the days of the early South Florida railway industry. This child-sized version of
                    Henry
                    Flagler’s railroad steam engine will help children better understand the importance of the Florida
                    East
                    Coast Railway.</p>

                <p class="p-underline">Train Depot</p>

                    Depot
                    replica. Through play, children will understand the importance of using trains as transportation
                    during
                    the
                    early 1900s</p>

                <p class="p-underline">Boynton Hotel</p>

                <p>Set the table, arrange food on a tray, don an apron and have a tea party at the original Boynton

                    established by Nathan Smith Boynton in 1900.</p>

            <p class="p-underline">Dairy Days</p>

            <p>Grab a bucket, toss on some overalls and prepare to experience the farm life! Children can feed and
                milk
                a
                life-sized cow replica and then process the milk for delivery.</p>

            <p class="p-underline">Pepper Patch Farm</p>

            <p>Surrounded by a myriad of reds, greens and yellows, follow the production process of this native
                Florida
                vegetable from start to finish. Children can peddle a tractor to see how their own hard work can
                rush
                the
                peppers through the washing, sorting, and packing process.</p>

            <p class="p-underline">Old Farmhouse</p>

            <p>Forget buttons and switches that control modern-day appliances, experience home life from the early
                1900s
                by
                cooking on a wood-burning stove, pumping water into the sink with a hand pump and washing clothes in
                a
                bin
                with a washboard.</p>

                    the
                    action-packed journeys the mailman endured as he traversed the beach of South Florida, sans shoes,
                    traveling from Lake Worth to Miami to ensure proper delivery of the mail.</p>

                <p>Stock the shelves, track merchandise and run the cash register at the old-time general store.
                    Children
                    will
                    grasp the concept of shopping before the days of vast supercenters and commercial department stores.
                    Our
                    new Service Station provides some of the typical tools that a mechanic would need to repair the
                    family
                    car,
                    right down to the spare tires. The delivery truck parked out front is just waiting for a "fill up"
                    at
                    the
                    gas pump.</p>

                    care
                    for newborn babies. A mixture of props both new and old will allow children to connect doctor’s
                    office
                    environments from past and present. We are thrilled to have added Operation Challenge, providing an
                    interactive opportunity for children to learn about the human body and exercise their fine motor
                    skills
                    in
                    an exciting and challenging way.</p>

                <p class="p-underline">Post Office</p>
                <p>Weigh it, sort it and send it on its way. Children will learn the mail delivery process from start to
                    finish
                    in this child-sized mail hub. Incorporate South Florida history by delivering letters to the
                    mailboxes
                    of
                    real pioneer families!</p>

                <p class="p-underline">MAIN STREET, circa 1913, and Boynton is growing...</p>
                <p>Children love to discover something new, and this exhibit area changes seasonally, providing new
                    opportunities for pretend play by introducing new businesses that might have opened in Boynton’s
                    early
                    days. In winter, children can don an apron and pretend they’re bakers in “Birdie’s Bakery”, having
                    gingerbread fun, “baking” holiday treats, even stacking up a birthday cake. Come spring, the exhibit
                    changes to “Boynton Buds & Blooms” Flower Shop and summer brings “Ye Olde Fashioned Ice Cream
                    Shoppe”.
                    Join
                    us to see how Main Street Boynton grows!</p>
