            <p class="p-underline">Quieter Times to Visit</p>
            <span>Weekday afternoons after 1:30 pm are often less busy, quieter times to visit.</span>

            <p class="p-underline">Quieter Places and Exhibits</p>
            <span>Light, noise and crowds vary widely throughout the building.
                There are quieter places and exhibits throughout the Museum. These can vary depending on the time of
                day,
                time of year, and class schedules.
                Consider bringing noise reducing headphones.</span>

            <p class="p-underline">Restrooms</p>
            <span>Accessible restrooms located on both floors of the building, all are sensory-friendly and DO NOT have
                hand
                dryers or auto-flush mechanisms.
                There are two restrooms on the first floor across from the front desk as you enter the building. On the
                second floor opposite the staircase there is a woman’s restroom with 2 stalls and a men’s restroom.</span>

            <p class="p-underline">Membership</p>
            <span>Becoming a member allows unlimited visits for a year. This is a good option for families where members
                have
                limited stamina.</span>
